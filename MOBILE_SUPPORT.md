# Mobile Support Plan

1.  **Responsive Layout:**
    *   Use Tailwind CSS's responsive breakpoints (`sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`) to adjust the layout.
    *   The main view should be a single column on mobile.
    *   The sidebar with the mini-apps list should be hidden by default on mobile and toggleable with a menu button.
2.  **Header:**
    *   Add a hamburger menu button to the header to toggle the sidebar on mobile.
    *   The "Promptlet" title should be centered.
    *   The "Settings" and "Theme" buttons should be on the right.
3.  **Sidebar:**
    *   The sidebar should be a full-width overlay or slide-in from the left when opened on mobile.
    *   Add a close button to the sidebar.
4.  **Chat View:**
    *   The chat input area should be at the bottom of the screen.
    *   The send button should be more prominent.
5.  **Modals:**
    *   Ensure that the "Create new mini-app" and "Settings" modals are responsive and usable on mobile devices.
